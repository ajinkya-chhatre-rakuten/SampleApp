/**
 *  Abstract model class whose subclasses automatically inherit the ability to produce deep (one level of depth) copies.
 *
 *  This class is designed to be subclassed for models who must support NSCopying. This class uses the Objective-C runtime to query all
 *  properties of the receiving class up to and excluding properties of RWCAutoCopyableModel. From that property list, any weak properties
 *  are ignored since they are not reliable for equality and can often lead to infinite loops with a child-parent relationship in the
 *  @c RWCAutoCopyableModel::description method. Any remaining properties are used in the @c RWCAutoCopyableModel::description,
 *  @c RWCAutoCopyableModel::hash, and @c RWCAutoCopyableModel::isEqual: methods via key-value-coding.
 *
 *  For copying, the list of properties is further filtered to ignore readonly properties without a backing Ivar synthesized, since setting
 *  such a property would likely result in an exception. The copy is produced using a simple @c -init call, so subclasses which define a
 *  designated initializer should take care to either produce a valid @c -init convenience initializer or override the NSCopying
 *  implementation.
