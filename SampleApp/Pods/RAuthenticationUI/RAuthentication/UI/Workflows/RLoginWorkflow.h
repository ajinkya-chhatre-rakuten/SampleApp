/**
 * Standard high-level login workflow.
 *
 * This workflow bundles standard logic to log a user in, using the developer-supplied
 * @ref RLoginDialog "login dialog" and @ref rauthenticator_factory_block_t "authenticator factory".
 *
 * @ref authentication-sso "Single Sign-On" is also supported transparently, provided
 * it has not been disabled. An optional @ref RAccountSelectionDialog "account selection dialog"
 * can be set to let users pick from a list of most-recently used accounts.
 *
 * Once a workflow has been set up, developers only get to call its @ref RBuiltinLoginWorkflow::start "start"
 * method to eventually receive an @ref RAuthenticationAccount "account".
 *
 * @note The login workflow is not retained globally, and must be retained by the caller. Otherwise
 *       all operations are cancelled and the completion block is never invoked.
 *
 * @attention This API is still in-progress and should change a bit in upcoming releases.
 *            Specific areas of improvements:
 *            - @ref RBuiltinLoginWorkflow::start and @ref RBuiltinLoginWorkflow::cancel look like
 *            `NSOperation` methods, and using an `NSOperation` subclass for the workflow would
 *            actually make more sense.
 *            - There should be a `RLoginWorkflow` abstract class, or some other way to provide
 *            concrete alternate workflows that extend or change the behavior of this one (though
 *            this is dangerous territory where application developers can break things in other
 *            apps if not getting Single Sign-On right).
