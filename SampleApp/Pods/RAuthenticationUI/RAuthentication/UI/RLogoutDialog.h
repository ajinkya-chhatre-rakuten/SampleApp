/**
 *  Built-in logout dialog for @ref authentication-sso "Single Sign-On" enabled applications.
 *
 *  The dialog is localized in both US English and Japanese. Other translations can be provided by the applications.
 *
 *  @note Applications not enabled for @ref authentication-sso "Single Sign-On" should implement their own logout
 *        UI/UX and use neither RBuiltinLogoutDialog nor RBuiltinLogoutWorkflow.
 *
 *  @attention This class is UI only, and no actual logout takes place. Please see our
 *             @ref RBuiltinLogoutWorkflow "standard Single Sign-On logout workflow" for an all-in-one
 *             solution to log users out, or RAuthenticationAccount::logoutWithSettings:options:completion:
 *             for the low-level call to log out from an account.
 *
 *  ### Preview
 *  @image html RBuiltinLogoutDialog.png "Preview" width=80%

 *  ### Custom logo
 *  As with the other built-in dialogs provided within this module, you can set a
 *  custom logo by including an image named `RAuthenticationLogo` in your application bundle.
